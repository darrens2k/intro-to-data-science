# Midterm Outline

For this portion of the midterm, you have been provided a business case and data set to solve. You are required to complete the business case, and answer all questions provided. You may answer your questions in a Jupyter Notebook, by using Markdown cells. Your final notebook should include all Python code that you used for analysis and all answers to the provided questions. Once you're finished, you can upload your Python notebook as your submission.

#### Business Case
You're currently an analyst working at an e-commerce company which sells beauty and fashion products. The websites receives a lot of traffic (i.e., many customers are visiting), and most visitors put items in their cart. However, less than 30% users actually check out after they have added items to their cart.

You'd like to understand why that might be the case, and to make some recommendations to the Product team on which user groups are not performing well so they can take appropriate action. You have the following data set to work with:

    'userID': unique user identifier  
    'age': age  
    'sessions': session identifier for each user  
    'time_spent': minutes spent browsing the website  
    'pages_visited': count of pages visited on the website  
    'cart_items': number of items in the user's cart  
    'cart_value': total $ value of the cart  
    'checkout_status': 1 or 0 indicating wether the user checked out or not (1=Yes, 0=No)  
    'device': the type of device the user is using (Desktop, Mobile or Tablet)  
    'location': the user's location  

#### Tasks
Conduct analysis on the provided data to identify the characteristics of users who check out, and those who don't. 

1) Based on your analysis, what can you conclude about the behaviour or characteristics of users who complete check out vs those who do not?
2) How did you prepare your data for analysis? Describe your data cleaning and preparation approaches, and why these were the best choices.
3) What recommendations do you have for the product team? What should they do next? Be specific (i.e., who should they target, why and how).

Once you're finished, submit your completed notebook with answers to the above questions included in Markdown cells. Your code should be legible, easy to follow, and your answers to the questions should be clear and precise.
