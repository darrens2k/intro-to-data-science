# Exam Outline

### Business Case:
You work for a grocery subscription company, where customers can subscribe on a monthly basis to receive a variety of groceries to their door. The groceries come from a regular grocery store, and customers can choose how many or which type of groceries to receive each month. 

You've noticed recently that the rate of customer-churn is higher than in previous months, and you'd like to understand why. You have been provided a data set which offers the following information:

    Customer_id: the customer's unique identifier
    Age: the customer's age
    Location: the country the customer lives in
    Device: the device the customer uses (Android or iOS)
    And 12 months of data related to:
        - their monthly spend (i.e., the total amount the customer spent in a month)
        - the number of items purchased in the month
        - the number of support calls placed in the month (i.e., how many times they called customer service)

This data represents customers who churned or did not churn last month, and has 12 months of previous activity. 

### Main Questions/Tasks

The main question you need to answer is: which factors can help us predict if a customer will churn?

In addition to the main question, you need to complete the following:

1. Conduct exploratory analysis on the provided dataset. State your hypothesis based on the insights from your exploration.

2. Prepare your data for modelling (i.e., data cleaning and feature engineering).

3. Build a model to predict the output variable. Hint: you will need to try several models to find the best model for your problem.

4. Evaluate each model using the evaluation techniques you have learned in class.

5. Select and optimize your final model.

6. Explain your model to a business executive. Your explanation should include the following:

    1. Your data exploration findings, initial hypothesis, and whether the hypothesis proved true.
    2. Your approach for building and evaluating the model. 
    3. The final model you selected and how you know this is the best model for the problem.
    4. How the model should be used by the business, in business process.

Once you're finished, please submit a completed Jupyter notebook. Please check your submission to ensure the file uploaded is the correct file.
