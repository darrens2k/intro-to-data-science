# Project Outline

#### Please note that I cannot upload the actual used dataset.

In this group project, you will work in teams of 5-6 students to analyze a real-world dataset and develop predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. Your task is to apply the concepts learned throughout the course to address a practical problem and present your findings in a final report.

1. Choose a real-world dataset: Your team should select a dataset from a reputable source, such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or a government open data portal. The dataset should have a reasonable size and complexity to allow for meaningful analysis.

2. Define a problem statement and hypothesis: Your team should define a direction for your analysis, and you should have some expectations to begin with.

3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA): Perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand its characteristics, identify trends, and detect anomalies. This should include data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizations, and descriptive statistics.

4. Feature engineering: Apply appropriate techniques to transform, scale, and select features that will be used in your predictive models.

5. Model development: Implement various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and support vector machines. Optimize each model using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques.

6. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, MSE, and RMSE. Compare the performance of the different models and select the best one(s) for your problem.

7. Final report: Prepare a comprehensive report (10-15 pages) that documents your analysis, methodology, results, and conclusions. The report should be well-structured, clear, and concise, with appropriate figures, tables, and citations.
