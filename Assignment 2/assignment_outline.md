# Assignment 2 Outline

#### This was a scenario based assignment, the scenario is described below:

You work for a mobile application as a Product Analyst, and you're testing changes to an existing feature. You would like to release changes to a key feature and have prepared 2 possible variants.  You've been running an experiment for 2 weeks, and now have some data with the experiment results. Specifically, you have the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) and Average Time Spent, in minutes, for each feature. The CTR means that the user is moving through different parts of the feature. A CTR of 1 would indicate the user has fully clicked on everything in a feature, while a CTR of 0 means they have not clicked anything. Your task is as follows:

1. Analyze the results to determine which feature (if any) results in CTR or Time Spent lift.

2. Conduct statistical testing to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the features and the control group.

3. Summarize your results. Make a recommendation to the engineering team about which feature to deploy. 

4. Create a roll-out plan. How quickly will you introduce the feature to your audience?

You should submit a Jupyter Notebook which holds the code for questions 1 and 2, and you can use Markdown cells for questions 3 and 4.
