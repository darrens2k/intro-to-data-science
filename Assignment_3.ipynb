    "\n",
    "A categorical column was created to act as a binary identifier for whether or not a house was renovated. The creation of dummy variables will be handled via one hot encoding when the data pipeline is being built.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction was not applied to the dataset because there are not an overly large amount of columns / dimensions. The effort / extra computation time it would require would likely not be worth what little performance gains it could offer in this case.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Since regression models are sensitive to outliers, a box plot was created for each numerical variable and any obviuos outliers were removed from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin regression modelling, a ride regression was used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This was chosen because it utilizes L2 regularization, a process that will trend the coefficients of features that have lower impacts on the model towards 0, but will not remove them. This will be a starting point for feature selection. \n",

    "* First, the target and input features must be defined. The target feature is price and the input features are initially every column of the dataset (split into categorical and numerical data) except for the id column. \n",

    "* Second a data pipeline is built. This will handle the one hot encoding of the categorical features and perform a Min-Max scaling on the numerical data to allow it to be processed by the regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Third, a ridge regression is applied. The model is fit and predictions are created. The RMS error of the model is printed as well as the RMS of the coefficicents with the features and their corresponding coefficients. The features with smaller coefficients than the others (less than half the RMS of the coefficicents are dropped), and this process is repreated 3 more times after which the final feature set has been found.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a ridge regression for feature selection was the best fit for this data because I had no insights going into it. Just by looking at the columns it is difficult to make any predictions about which columns could have a great impact on the price of the house. I chose ridge regression over Lasso or ElasticNet since it does not delete features. I would like to be able to follow the process and review the columns that model deems irrelevant, as opposed to having them just removed and the model fit around them."

    "Each of these models were fit, predictions were generated and their RMS Error was determined as well as the RMS Error as a percentage of the mean house price.   \n",

    "It was found that the best model is a Simple Linear Regression. All of the models have RMS Errors within 0.1% of each other, meaning they perform similarly. The Simple Linear Regression was chosen because it is the least computationally expensive of the models, and given that they all perform the same, computational efficiency should be optimized. If further testing was done to optimize the hyper parameters of the other models perhaps they could achieve better results, but given the tools I am familiar with, the mean squared error is the best performance indicator. And going solely off the mean squared error, the Simple Linear Regression is the best model."
